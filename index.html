The expertise enables us to carry out any I.T project with an exceptional speed. The technical personnel of the company have perfect understanding of the field level requirements of the Universities, corporate bodies and R & D institutions and hence the system design is made according to the best interest of the users. We care for the user acceptance since user acceptance is crucial to the success of any I.T application. Accordingly, the complications of system design never get reflected in the front end. The front end uses the best of GUI, thus reducing the time and cost on training.

                        <strong>1. Expertise in disaster recovery</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Disasters such as hardware crash, Operating System (OS) crash and database crash pose nightmarish experience to any organisation. Unless a strong system of disaster recovery is in position, any organisation is bound to suffer. A robust disaster recovery system is a pre requisite for any professional organisation, without which the role of a system administrator / database administrator becomes a fire fighter rather than an administrator. Any bought in disaster recovery software not only enhances the cost of operations but also poses problems in customising the same. Firstline Infotech builds any application software on a disaster recovery platform. So, in the event of a disaster, whether it is related to hardware, Operating System or the database itself, the disaster recovery package restores the lost data within minutes. 
                        The use of such robust disaster recovery software is one of the reasons for the success of the technical team that solve two server hard disk crashes and one database crash within hours. No data had been lost due to in built disaster recovery feature. The disaster recovery feature is also an in-house development.  All the software packages being developed by the Firstline Infotech teams are built on a similar disaster recovery platform. Hence, the clients get an added service, which assures them a headache free electronic office functioning with assured database safety. The client gets the rich experience of the Firstline’s team in handling disaster recovery within minutes. The disaster recovery mechanism itself is highly automated and user friendly.

                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        <strong>2. High end security system</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">
                        Today, the I.T clients require not only a free flowing software but also a software which withstands all types of hacking, be it from within the organisation or from outside the organisation. The clients also need software, which does not require the presence of technical personnel all the time. In short, the application software should contain extremely user friendly features which enable easy operations and software administration by the users while blocking with all its might any unauthorised intrusions. The system should be administered by the non-technical officials themselves. Any software/database servicing would be restricted to the barest minimum. Such need for servicing should arise only in the event of a crash or failure of hardware. In the normal course, the non-technical people should be able to handle all the day to day requirements.
                        The technical teams with Firstline have the rich experience of developing a User Manager with foolproof security features. This web enabled user manager portion had been built in all software developed or under development at Firstline. 
                        The web enabled user manager module can be handled by a non-technical staff working in the organisation. He/she has the right to assign and revoke rights on the application software. The role played by this staff is called software administrator. However, the software administrator has very little rights on the server operating system. Usually the software administrator has “server operator” right only. Similarly the software administrator has no special rights on the database administration.  The authority of the software administrator in assigning and revoking rights on the application software is also severely restricted. For example, the software administrator cannot assign approval rights to a clerical staff and vice versa.  Every time the user updates the database by pressing “save”, “modify” buttons, the system automatically captures the user’s identity which is permanently stored on the system. The identity of the users who took part in an online transaction can be ascertained easily. This provides total security to the system from all directions. The latest build security system has MD5 checksum based intranet digital signature tool. Every transaction is hashed and kept separately for online verification of the integrity of the records. This gives a paper-like quality to the electronic database.

                        The technical experts working in Firstline Infotech Pvt. Ltd., have rich experience in workflow automation. The design, development and implementation of all application software packages are based on a workflow engine which specifies the rights according to designation of users. The rights and privileges are exclusive and not inter changeable.
